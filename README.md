# MangAdmin
MangAdmin ([MaNGOS](https://github.com/mangosthree/server) Admin) is a [World of Warcraft](http://battle.net/wow/) addon which simplifies the in-game administration of private MMORPG servers (for example with a ticket-management system). It is licensed under GNU General Public License 3.0.

The project was created from an idea and a first conception by Athrus from mangosproject.org forums. The addon was my very first open-source project and has not been maintained since 2008. The [official releases](https://code.google.com/p/mangadmin/downloads/list) provided on the old Google-Code page have been downloaded more than 116k times.

I've also found out there exist YouTube videos which include in-game presentations of the addon. For example this one: https://youtu.be/9Y5lFAjdmvw?t=509

The project was forked multiple times (TrinityAdmin, FireAdmin) to be compatible with other servers, e.g. [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore).
