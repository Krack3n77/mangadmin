# MangAdmin
MaNGOS Administrator is a World of Warcraft addon licensed under GNU General Public License 3.0.


MangAdmin helps administrators of private Massive Network Game Object Servers (public hosting was against MaNGOS Terms of Use) to manage their server (for example with a ticket-management system). 
The project was created with an idea and a first conception by Athrus from mangosproject.org forums which do not exist anymore. The addon was my very first open-source project and has not been maintained since 2008. It very probably does not work anymore.

Later, a fork - TrinityAdmin - was created:
