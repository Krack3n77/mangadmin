# MangAdmin
MangAdmin ([MaNGOS](https://github.com/mangosthree/server) Admin) is a [World of Warcraft](http://battle.net/wow/) addon which simplifies the in-game administration of private MMORPG servers (for example with a ticket-management system). It is licensed under GNU General Public License 3.0.

The project was created from an idea and a first conception by Athrus from mangosproject.org forums. The addon was my very first open-source project and has not been maintained since 2008. It probably does not work anymore.

Later, a fork - TrinityAdmin - was created:
